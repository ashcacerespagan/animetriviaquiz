# animetriviaquiz

This was one of my more playful projects, where I combined my interest in anime with GUI design. The app delivers multiple-choice questions across popular anime series and gives real-time score tracking and feedback. It served as my practice ground for managing quiz logic, multi-scene navigation, and responsive UI layout.
